# News Summarizer Project

Website that scrapes and summarizes major news sources.
You can view the [website here](http://142.93.119.27:5000/)

My hope is that this can be a platform where you don't have to worry about scraping or crawling web sites,
instead you just consume events from a stream, so you can focus on trying to add new features

# Documentation (WIP)
To be added
